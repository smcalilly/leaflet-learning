# Docker

filling in knowledge gaps about docker

## docker vs docker-compose
docker builds an image based on a dockerfile. docker can run the container. docker-compose can mangage multiple running containers â€” the services that interact with each other. so docker-compose needs some docker images to run as containers.


## docker-compose
declares an application and its dependent services. nice way to create the app's environment + connect it to a database. you can connect ports across the "network" (?)

there are several versions of it. use v2 because it's got some good health checks.

### examples
build the images:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

it might look like this:
```bash
