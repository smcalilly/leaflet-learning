# questions about python
filling in the gaps about python

## questions
- what does `yield` do? [seen here](https://github.com/opencivicdata/python-legistar-scraper/blob/master/legistar/base.py#L202).
- generators? [this author says](https://medium.com/workpath-thewaywework/learning-ruby-2-things-i-like-2-things-i-miss-from-python-6f60af8ed16c), "From Python, the thing thatâ€™ll stick with me is generators. Especially for processing data, it just becomes so natural (and memory-efficient) to express generation or transformation of data through generators."
- learn more data structures. don't ever use the set. deque?
