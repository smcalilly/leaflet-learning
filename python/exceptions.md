## raising exceptions

when an exception is raised, it appears to stop program execution immediately. any lines that were supposed to happen after the exception are not exectued, and unless the execption is dealt with, the program will exit with an error message. raising an exception stops all execution right up the function call stack until it is either hanleded, or forces the interpreter to exit.

the interpreter isn't taking a shortcut and exiting immediately; the exception can be handled inside either method. exceptions can be handled at any level after they are initially raised.

## handling exceptions
if we encounter an exception, how should our code react to or recover from it? we handle exceptions by wrapping any code that might throw one inside a `try...catch` clause. (whether it is exception code itself, or a call to any function or method that may have an exception raised inside it. it looks like this:
```python
try:
    function_that_raises_exception()
except:
    print('I caught an exception')
print('I am executing after the exception')
```

if we run this script (assuming that `function_that_raises_exception` will in fact raise exception), then we get this output:
```python
I am about to raise exception
I caught an exception
I'm executing after the exception
```

we caught the exception and "were able to clean up after ourselves", (in this case, by outputting that we were handling the situation)

try...catch...finally

## exception hierarchy
`Exception` inherits from `BaseException`, and all the subclasses of Exception come from that, except for `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`, which derive directly from BaseException instead of Exception

- `SystemExit` is an exception that is raised whenever the program exits naturally, typically because we called the sys.exit unction somehwere in our code. the exception is designed to allow us to clean up code before the program ultimately exits, so we generally don't need to handle it explicitly (because cleanup code happens inside a finally clause). usually, if we handle SystemExit at all, it's because we want to do something special with it or are anticipating it directly. we especially don't want it to be accidentally cuaght in generic clauses that catch all normal exceptions. this is why it derives direclty from BaseException
- `KeybaordInterrupt` is common in command-line programs. standard way for a the user to deliberately interrupt a running program, and like `SystemExit`, it should almost always respond by terminating the program. 

it's a bad idea to simply do `except:` without an arguments because it will catch all of the exceptions, including those two. to not catch those, you should do`except Exception:`.

## defining own exceptions
easy to do, just inherit from the `Exception` class. don't even have to add any content to the class:
```python
class InvalidWithdrawal(Exception):
    pass

rasie InvalidWithdrawal('You do not have any money.')
```
