## summary levels
like
- census blocks
- block groups
- census tracts
- counties
  - county subdivisions
  - voting districts
  - traffic analysis zones
- states
  - school districts
  - congressional districts
  - urban growth areas
  - state legislative districts
  - public use microdata areas
  - places
- native areas
- divisions
- regions
- nation
  - zip code tabulation areas
  - urban areas
  - core based statistical areas


### places
how do you look up data for a city/town?
it's likely you want to look at "places"
easiest to think of places as cities, towns, vilalges, or boroughs

### county subdivisions
in some states, serve as local governments like cities/towns. other states, primarily used as a statistical division. see minute 2:17 for a list of states where you might want to look at county subdivision rather than place: https://youtu.be/y58vRDRwFPg?t=137. michigan, minnesota

### metro area (core based statistical areas)
one or more counties tied together economically & socially, like New York-Newark-Jersey City metro area. or Birmingham, AL

include metropolitan and micropolitan areas. some micropolitan areas are bigger than some metropolitan areas

### urban areas
similar to metro areas. based on population and land use. "more technical summary area that you may never need to use"

## how do you search for data to compare within a city/town?
block groups and census tracts

### block groups
block groups are the smallest area for which estimates from the ACS are available. keep this in mind when you're looking at the data, which will be more subject to uncertainty because of the samll sample size. **consider the margins of error**. more advanced users of census data often use block groups to make geographies that aren't covered by the census area

### census tract
also used to compare different parts of larger geographies. larger samples than block groups, so more resilient to sampling error.

### what is "PUMA"?
public use microdata area
used to look up data for areas within a city

### NECTA
new england city town/area. defined by county subdivisions than counties

### American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian Areas
these areas are identified as "native area" on census reporter. see the list of summary levels representing parts of native areas: https://youtu.be/y58vRDRwFPg?t=309

### divisions & regions
grouped geographically
9 census divisions that make up the 4 census regions
