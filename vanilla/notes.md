# leaflet
basic introduction to leaflet in vanilla js, [following this guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/)

messing around with mapping basic shapes in tupelo, mississippi.

tried to add a form where i could input lat/long coordinates and then go to that location, but my first attempt didn't work.

### geojson
https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/

"GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures"

"A GeoJSON object may represent a region of space (a Geometry), a spatially dounded entity (a Feature), or a list of Features (a FeatureCollection). GeoJSON supports the following geometry types: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection"
